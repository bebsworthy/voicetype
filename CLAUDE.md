# Development Instructions

## Overview

This document is your bible on how we work together and the documentation file structure in the `./documentation` folder.

## Task management

We use two files to keep track of the work in progress.

- [tasks.md - The current list of tasks in progress](./documentation/tasks.md): **ALWAYS READ THIS FILE**
- [tasks.backlog.md - The backlog of non-scheduled task](./documentation/tasks.backlog.md) **DO NOT READ UNLESS TOLD TO**
- [open-questions.md - List of open questions](./documentation/open-questions.md) **DO NOT READ UNLESS TOLD TO**

# How to use `tasks.md`

You **MUST** **ALWAYS** maintain the `tasks.md` file in the project root that tracks your
progress through the task list.

- DO group task by features then by phases then by individual tasks
- DO prefix completed tasks with ✅
- DO properly reformat the file if it is improperly formated
- DO NOT add new section to the tasks.md other than the one specified below
- DO NOT add completion date to tasks
- DO NOT add duration estimation to tasks

## Actions on task
List of usual action that I can ask you to do

### **Next Task** (What is the next task / start the next task)

Used to find the next task to work on.

- Read `tasks.md`
- Analyze the tasks, feature and project information
- *IMPORTANT* Read the feature specifications file indicated by `Feature Specification`
- If you have any open questions or if there are any open-ended instruction for the task, write them to the "Open Questions" section of `open-questions.md` with suggestion on how to answer the questions and STOP.
- If you don't have any open questions for the task, summarize your next actions to implement the tasks and wait for confirmation to start

### **Review Task** (Review the task / Review current task / Check the task)

Used to review the next tasks for issues with the specifications of the tasks.

- Read `tasks.md`
- Analyze the tasks, feature and project information
- *IMPORTANT* Read the feature specifications file indicated by `Feature Specification`
- Reviews the features specification for inconsistency, unclear specification, information gap or open-ended instruction.
- If find any issues write them down to the **Specification Error** section of `open-questions.md`
- For each inconsistency give a suggestion on how to correct it.
- STOP and wait for instruction

### **Prioritize Task** (Prioritize the task / Sort the task / Optimize the tasks)

Used to reorganize the task list to prioritize user facing functionality while maintaining quality.

- Read `tasks.md`
- Analyze the tasks, feature and project information
- *IMPORTANT* Read the feature specifications file indicated by `Feature Specification`
- Reviews the pending task list and suggest a reorganization to maximize user value delivery.
- If your proposition is accepted you will re-organize the phases and the tasks making sure to re-number them and update the `tasks.md` file
- DO NOT modify the order of completed tasks

### **Read Tasks Answers to questions** (Read answers / Read questions / I have answered)

Used to indicate that I have answered the questions or issue raised in `open-questions.md` 

- Read `tasks.md`
- Analyze the tasks, feature and project information
- *IMPORTANT* Read the feature specifications file indicated by `Feature Specification`
- Read `open-questions.md` 
- Answers to open questions are indicated by "**Answer**:".
- Based on the answers plan updates for the specification and tasks definition.
- Review the information available and update `open-questions.md`:
  - Remove **completely** answered questions
  - Add new eventual questions
  - Leave unanswered questions

**About `tasks.md`** This is how the file should be formatted:

```markdown
# In progress

**Current Feature**: Name of the feature currently being implemented

## Feature 1: Name of the feature being implemented

### Feature Specification

- [1st document to read](./link_to_feature_spec.md)
- [2nd document to read](./link_to_feature_spec2.md)
- ...

### Phase 1: Project Foundation (2/2 completed)

- ✅ Task 1.1: Project Setup and Configuration
- ✅ Task 1.2: Type Definitions

### Phase 2: Sample Data and Utilities (0/3 completed)

- ✅ Task 2.1: Sample Data Creation
- Task 2.2: Utility Functions
- Task 2.3: Data Hooks

[Continue for all features, phases and tasks...]
```



## Project Documentation

All the documentation for the project is available in ./documentation/ 

- [project.spec.md - The overview of the project](./documentation/project.specs.md) **ALWAYS READ THIS FILE**


**Others files pattern**
 * `*.feat.md`: Technical specification about a specific feature (usually under development or preparation). **ALWAYS READ THIS FILE IF MENTIONNED IN THE CURRENT TASK or read as needed**
 * `*.spec.md`: Technical specification about a specific component other than the backend or the frontend (for example an external API or function) **ALWAYS READ THIS FILE IF MENTIONNED IN THE CURRENT TASK or read as needed**

### About `project.spec.md`

Contains a technical overview of the project and summary output similar to the output of the `tree` command indicating the purpose and the content of each folders and files.

**Example structure**

```markdown
# Project XYZ

* **Purpose:** A brief, high-level summary of the web application's purpose and its intended audience.
* **Scope:** Clearly define the boundaries of the frontend application. What features are included, and what is explicitly out of scope?
* **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** Define measurable goals for the frontend (e.g., page load time, Lighthouse score, user engagement metrics).

## Rules

- List of project specific rules
- Do this
- Don't do that

## Structure

Top level structure of the project as `tree` goes here, do not include the sub-tree for the components defined in frontend.spec.md or backend.spec.md
```

### About `*.spec.md`

Contains technical specification for a component of the application, usually the frontend and the backend but potentially a specific service or module if the complexity requires it.

**Example structure**

```markdown
# Project XYZ - Frontend Technical Specification

## 1. Architecture & Technology Stack

* **1.1 Architectural Style:** Describe the overall architecture (e.g., Component-Based, Micro-Frontend, Monolithic).
