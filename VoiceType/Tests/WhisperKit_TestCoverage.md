### 6. **WhisperKitLanguageTests.swift**
Multi-language support testing:
- Supported languages verification

- Explicit language selection
- Consecutive multilingual transcriptions
- Language switching performance
- Language-specific features
- Mixed language audio handling
- Language code mapping validation

## Updated Test Files

### WhisperKitIntegrationTests.swift
Fixed critical issues:
- Corrected AudioData creation to use Int16 samples instead of Float
- Fixed all sample data generation to match the correct type
- Updated performance tests with proper data types

### Features Not Yet Tested (Pending Implementation)
1. **Streaming Transcription** - Requires implementation first
2. **Word-level Timestamps** - Not yet extracted from results
3. **Voice Activity Detection** - Not yet implemented
4. **Download Resume/Cancel** - Requires enhanced download manager
5. **Model Migration** - No existing models to migrate

## Running the Tests

### Run All WhisperKit Tests
```bash
swift test --filter WhisperKit
```

### Run Specific Test Suites
```bash
# Model management tests
swift test --filter WhisperKitModelManagerTests

# Error handling tests
swift test --filter WhisperKitErrorHandlingTests

# Performance tests (skip in CI)
swift test --filter WhisperKitPerformanceTests

# Language tests
swift test --filter WhisperKitLanguageTests
```

### CI Considerations
Many tests check for `CI` environment variable and skip when running in continuous integration:
- Model loading tests (require actual models)
- Performance tests (require consistent hardware)
- Integration tests (require full environment)

## Test Data Helpers

All test files include proper helper methods for creating test data:
- `createMockAudioData()` - Creates silence audio with Int16 samples
- `createTestAudio()` - Creates audio with sine waves
- `createComplexAudio()` - Creates multi-frequency audio
- `getWhisperKitModelName()` - Maps model types to WhisperKit names

## Assertions and Validation

Tests validate:
- Correct types and data formats
- Performance within specifications
- Memory usage within limits
- Error messages are appropriate
- State transitions are correct
- Thread safety is maintained

## Future Test Additions

When implementing missing features, add tests for:
1. Streaming transcription callbacks
2. Partial result handling
3. Word-level timestamp accuracy
4. VAD threshold configuration
5. Download interruption and resume
6. Custom model support
7. Hugging Face integration
